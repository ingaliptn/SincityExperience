                <p>With so many entertainment venues available in the city of Las Vegas, it can be difficult to know just where to go. That’s where a Las Vegas Nightlife guide comes in handy. A Las Vegas Nightlife guide can show you where all the hottest clubs and venues are located, meaning you don’t need to worry about ending up in a terrible, dingy, nightclub. </p>
                <h2><span>Discover Vegas by night...</span></h2>
                <p>Las Vegas has hundreds, if not thousands of night-time entertainment venues, from Casino’s and showrooms to strip clubs and night clubs as well as <a href="/">escorts services</a>. With so much on over it’s no wonder Vegas is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Having so much available to choose from, how do you decide where to begin?</p>
                <p>First off, keep I mind what day off the week it is. Don’t be worried about hitting the clubs on a weekday, although not all the clubs will be open, there are still plenty of popular venues that are. If you have a particular destination in mind, then it is worth having a quick check on their website to ensure that they are open before you head out. Marquee and Foxtails are good clubs for a Monday night. For a Tuesday night check out 1Oak nightclub, Drias and Hyde. Surrender is an excellent choice for a Wednesday. And finally, for the weekdays, Thursday why not try the increasingly popular Body English or Tryst Nightclubs? Whist Fridays and Sundays are slightly slower than Saturdays; all the major nightclubs are usually extremely busy over the weekends, and there isn't much difference in the quality of the more popular venues.</p>
                <p>Secondly, have a look at the location of the clubs. Las Vegas is a big city so heading to a club closer to your hotel will not only save you money on cab fare. But you will also be able to locate your hotel easily, no matter how many drinks you may have had. Although, Downtown Las Vegas has become increasingly popular in recent years. With a more relaxed atmosphere and are a good alternative for visitors who are looking for less expensive venues, with a relaxed dress code. Most of the more popular tourist bars and clubs are located in an area of Downtown known as East Fremont. A couple of venues to look out for if you decide to head to the area are: Downtown Cocktail Room, The Griffin, Vanguard Lounge, Beauty Bar and Commonwealth. </p>
